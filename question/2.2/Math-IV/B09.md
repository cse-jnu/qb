**(a)** Show that

$$
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \quad \text{and} \quad e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta} = 2i\sin\theta
$$

graphically.

**(b)** Show that if $z(t) = e^{it}$ represents the position vector of a particle at time $t$, and then $iz$ represents the velocity whose direction is perpendicular to the direction of $z$ at any time $t$.

**(d)** Prove that $v(x,y) = \cos x \sinh y$ satisfies Laplaceâ€™s equation.
Find a function $u(x,y)$ such that

$$
f(x + iy) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)
$$

is analytic.

**1.**
a. Explain different types of equations with example.
b. How do you decide the two initial values that are required for using the bisection method? Find the root of the following equation using the bisection method:

$$
x^3 - 3x - 5 = 0
$$

**2.**
Write down the algorithm of the Newton–Raphson method to compute a real root of the equation $f(x) = 0$. Using this method, compute a root of the equation

$$
x\sin x + \cos x = 0,
$$

correct up to five decimal places.

**3.**
a. What is meant by forward difference?
b. The population in a village was recorded as follows:

| Year       | 1941 | 1951 | 1961 | 1971 | 1981 | 1991 |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Population | 2500 | 2800 | 3200 | 3700 | 4350 | 5225 |

Estimate the population for the year 1945 using Newton’s interpolation formula.

**4.**
Introduce the concept of divided differences and prove that the value of a divided difference is independent of the order of its arguments. Also prove that the $n$th divided differences of a polynomial of degree $n$ is constant.

**5.**
Derive Lagrange’s interpolation formula for unequal intervals. The function $y = \sin x$ is tabulated as:

| $x$        | $0$ | $\pi/4$ | $\pi/2$ |
| ---------- | --- | ------- | ------- |
| $y=\sin x$ | 0   | 0.70711 | 1.0     |

Using Lagrange’s interpolation formula, find the value of $\sin(\pi/6)$.

**6.**
The following table of values of $x$ and $y$ is given:

| $x$ | 0      | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      | 6      |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| $y$ | 6.9897 | 7.4036 | 7.7815 | 8.1291 | 8.4510 | 8.7506 | 9.0309 |

Find $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\displaystyle \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ at $x = 3$.

**7.**
Deduce the general quadrature formula for equidistant ordinates and hence derive Simpson’s 1/3 rule. Using this rule, evaluate

$$
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{1 + x}\,dx
$$

with $h = \tfrac{1}{6}$.

---

**8.**
Explain the Gaussian quadrature method to approximate an integral. Hence approximate

$$
\int_{-1}^{1} e^x \cos x \,dx
$$

using Gaussian quadrature with $n = 3$.

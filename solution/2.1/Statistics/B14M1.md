### 1. Population vs Sample; Parameter vs Statistic (with example):

* **Population:** All students in a university (e.g., 10,000 students).
* **Sample:** A group of 200 students selected randomly from the university.
* **Parameter:** The average GPA of all 10,000 students (unknown, fixed).
* **Statistic:** The average GPA calculated from the 200 students sample (used to estimate the parameter).

### 3. Bar Diagram — Detailed Explanation and Example:

#### What is a Bar Diagram?

* It is a visual tool to compare data across different categories.
* Bars can be drawn vertically or horizontally.
* The length/height of the bar is proportional to the quantity it represents.

#### How to Construct a Simple Bar Diagram? Step-by-Step:

1. **Collect data:** For example, the number of students in different departments:

   | Department | Students |
   | ---------- | -------- |
   | CSE        | 120      |
   | EEE        | 90       |
   | BBA        | 60       |

2. **Draw the axes:**

   * Horizontal axis (x-axis) for departments (categories).
   * Vertical axis (y-axis) for number of students (frequency).

3. **Label axes:**

   * Label the x-axis with department names: CSE, EEE, BBA.
   * Label the y-axis with a scale from 0 to, say, 150, with equal intervals.

4. **Choose scale:** The maximum value is 120 (CSE students), so y-axis can be scaled in steps of 10 or 20.

5. **Draw bars:**

   * Draw a bar above 'CSE' with height corresponding to 120.
   * Draw a bar above 'EEE' with height corresponding to 90.
   * Draw a bar above 'BBA' with height corresponding to 60.

6. **Equal width and spacing:** All bars must be the same width, with equal gaps between them.

7. **Title:** Add a title, for example, "Number of Students in Different Departments."

Number of Students
150 |                  |            
140 |                  |            
130 |                  |            
120 |  ████████████    |   (CSE)
110 |  ████████████    |            
100 |  ████████        |            
 90 |  ████████        |   (EEE)
 80 |  █████           |            
 60 |  █████           |   (BBA)
 50 |                  |            
 40 |                  |            
 30 |                  |            
    --------------------------------

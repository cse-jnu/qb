### Problem 1: Calculate the median and mode for the distribution of weights of 150 students.

Given data:

| Weight (kg) | Frequency (f) |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 30 - 40     | 18            |
| 40 - 50     | 37            |
| 50 - 60     | 45            |
| 60 - 70     | 27            |
| 70 - 80     | 15            |
| 80 - 90     | 8             |

Total number of students, $n = 150$.

---

#### Step 1: Calculate the median

**Step 1.1: Find cumulative frequencies (CF):**

| Weight (kg) | Frequency (f) | Cumulative Frequency (CF) |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 30 - 40     | 18            | 18                        |
| 40 - 50     | 37            | 18 + 37 = 55              |
| 50 - 60     | 45            | 55 + 45 = 100             |
| 60 - 70     | 27            | 100 + 27 = 127            |
| 70 - 80     | 15            | 127 + 15 = 142            |
| 80 - 90     | 8             | 142 + 8 = 150             |

---

**Step 1.2: Locate median class**

Median class is the class where the cumulative frequency is just greater than or equal to $\frac{n}{2} = \frac{150}{2} = 75$.

From the table, CF just greater than 75 is 100 (corresponding to 50-60 class).

So, **Median class:** 50-60

---

**Step 1.3: Use the formula for median**

$$
\text{Median} = L + \left( \frac{\frac{n}{2} - F}{f_m} \right) \times h
$$

Where:

* $L = 50$ (lower boundary of median class)
* $n = 150$ (total frequency)
* $F = 55$ (cumulative frequency before median class)
* $f_m = 45$ (frequency of median class)
* $h = 10$ (class width)

Calculate:

$$
\text{Median} = 50 + \left( \frac{75 - 55}{45} \right) \times 10 = 50 + \left(\frac{20}{45}\right) \times 10 = 50 + 4.44 = 54.44
$$

---

#### Step 2: Calculate the mode

The mode formula for grouped data is:

$$
\text{Mode} = L + \left( \frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2} \right) \times h
$$

Where:

* $L$ = lower boundary of modal class
* $f_1$ = frequency of modal class
* $f_0$ = frequency of class before modal class
* $f_2$ = frequency of class after modal class
* $h$ = class width

---

**Step 2.1: Identify the modal class**

The modal class is the class with the highest frequency.

From frequency table, the highest frequency is 45 in 50-60 class.

So, **Modal class = 50-60**

---

**Step 2.2: Find $L$, $f_1$, $f_0$, $f_2$, and $h$**

* $L = 50$
* $f_1 = 45$
* $f_0 = 37$ (frequency of previous class 40-50)
* $f_2 = 27$ (frequency of next class 60-70)
* $h = 10$

---

**Step 2.3: Calculate mode**

$$
\text{Mode} = 50 + \left( \frac{45 - 37}{2(45) - 37 - 27} \right) \times 10 = 50 + \left( \frac{8}{90 - 64} \right) \times 10 = 50 + \left( \frac{8}{26} \right) \times 10 = 50 + 3.08 = 53.08
$$

---

### Final answers for Problem 1:

* Median = **54.44 kg**
* Mode = **53.08 kg**

### Problem 2: First four moments of a distribution about $\Lambda = 5$ for data 10, 20, 30, and 40. Then comment on the nature of distribution.

---

Given data points: 10, 20, 30, 40
Given $\Lambda = 5$

---

#### Step 2.1: Calculate moments about $\Lambda$

Formula for $r$-th moment about $\Lambda$:

$$
\mu'_r = \frac{1}{n} \sum (x_i - \Lambda)^r
$$

---

Calculate moments step by step:

| $x_i$ | $x_i - 5$ | $(x_i - 5)^2$ | $(x_i - 5)^3$ | $(x_i - 5)^4$ |
| ----- | --------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 10    | 5         | 25            | 125           | 625           |
| 20    | 15        | 225           | 3375          | 50625         |
| 30    | 25        | 625           | 15625         | 390625        |
| 40    | 35        | 1225          | 42875         | 1500625       |

---

Sum for each:

$$
\sum (x_i - 5)^1 = 5 + 15 + 25 + 35 = 80
$$

$$
\sum (x_i - 5)^2 = 25 + 225 + 625 + 1225 = 2100
$$

$$
\sum (x_i - 5)^3 = 125 + 3375 + 15625 + 42875 = 62000
$$

$$
\sum (x_i - 5)^4 = 625 + 50625 + 390625 + 1500625 = 1952500
$$

---

Calculate moments:

$$
\mu'_1 = \frac{80}{4} = 20
$$

$$
\mu'_2 = \frac{2100}{4} = 525
$$

$$
\mu'_3 = \frac{62000}{4} = 15500
$$

$$
\mu'_4 = \frac{1952500}{4} = 488125
$$

### Comments on the nature of distribution based on moments:

* First moment (mean about $\Lambda$) = 20
* Second moment (variance) is large (525), indicating a spread out data.
* Third moment is positive (15500), suggesting right-skewed distribution.
* Fourth moment (kurtosis) is large, indicating a peaked distribution or heavy tails.

---

### Problem 3: Show that

$$
\mu_3 = \mu'_3 - 3\mu'_2 \mu'_1 + 2 \mu_1'^3
$$

---

This is the relationship between the third central moment ($\mu_3$) and raw moments ($\mu'_r$).

* $\mu_1' =$ first raw moment (mean)
* $\mu_2' =$ second raw moment
* $\mu_3' =$ third raw moment
* $\mu_3 =$ third central moment (moment about the mean)

The formula is a known identity in statistics.

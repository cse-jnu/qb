### 1. Definitions (2 marks)

* **Statistics**
  The science of collecting, organizing, summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to aid decision-making under uncertainty.

* **Population**
  The entire set of individuals or items of interest in a study (e.g. all students in a university).

* **Sample**
  A subset of the population selected for measurement or observation, intended to represent the population (e.g. 200 students chosen at random).

* **Variable**
  A characteristic or attribute of an individual or item that can take on different values (e.g. height, gender, test score).

### 2. Parameter vs. Statistic (2 marks)

|                      | **Parameter**                              | **Statistic**                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**       | A numerical summary of a **population**    | A numerical summary of a **sample**              |
| **Example**          | Population mean μ, population proportion P | Sample mean $\bar x$, sample proportion $\hat p$ |
| **Known?**           | Generally **unknown**, estimated from data | Computed directly from the sample                |
| **Use in inference** | True value we seek to estimate             | Estimate used to infer the parameter             |

### 3. Scales of Measurement (3 marks)

| **Variable**        | **Scale** | **Justification**                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gender              | Nominal   | Categories (e.g. “Male”, “Female”) with no inherent order.                                              |
| Examination grade   | Ordinal   | Ordered categories (e.g. A > B > C), but intervals between grades are not equal.                        |
| I.Q. score          | Interval  | Numerical values with equal intervals; zero does not imply “no intelligence” (no true zero).            |
| Jersey number       | Nominal   | Labels (e.g. 7, 10, 23) serving as identifiers, not quantities.                                         |
| Economic status     | Ordinal   | Ordered categories (e.g. Low, Medium, High), but distance between levels is not uniform.                |
| Number of accidents | Ratio     | Counts with a true zero (zero accidents means none occurred) and meaningful ratios (e.g. 4 is twice 2). |

### 4. Bar Diagram: Definition and Construction (3 marks)

**Definition.**
A **bar diagram** (or bar chart) is a graphical display of categorical data in which each category is represented by a rectangular bar whose height (or length) is proportional to its frequency or relative frequency.

**Construction of a Simple Bar Diagram.**

1. **Select Categories.**
   Identify the distinct categories (e.g. economic status levels).

2. **Draw Axes.**
   – Horizontal (x-axis): categories, spaced equally.
   – Vertical (y-axis): scale of frequencies or percentages.

3. **Scale the Vertical Axis.**
   – Choose an appropriate range from zero up to the maximum frequency.
   – Label at regular intervals.

4. **Plot Bars.**
   – For each category, draw a bar of constant width whose height equals its frequency.
   – Ensure bars are separated by small gaps (to emphasize categorical nature).

5. **Label and Title.**
   – Provide a clear title (“Bar Diagram of Economic Status”).
   – Label axes (“Economic Status” on x-axis, “Number of Individuals” on y-axis).
   – Optionally annotate each bar with its exact value.

6. **Legend (if needed).**
   – If multiple series are shown (e.g. male vs. female), include a legend to distinguish them.

### (c) Scales of Measurement

| **Variable**          | **Scale** | **Justification**                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Economic status       | Ordinal   | Categories (Low, Medium, High) with a meaningful order but unequal intervals.                    |
| Race                  | Nominal   | Categories (e.g., Asian, African, Caucasian) without any order.                                  |

| Day temperature       | Interval  | Measured in °C or °F: equal differences meaningful, but zero is arbitrary (not “no heat”).       |
| Length of schooling   | Ratio     | Measured in years: true zero (no schooling) and meaningful ratios (e.g., 10 yrs is twice 5 yrs). |
| Happiness             | Ordinal   | Often captured on a Likert scale (Unhappy, Neutral, Happy) with order but not equal spacing.     |
| Telephone number      | Nominal   | Identifier labels for subscribers; arithmetic operations are meaningless.                        |
| Eye color             | Nominal   | Categories (Blue, Brown, Green) with no inherent order.                                          |
| Opinion               | Ordinal   | Ordered categories (Disagree → Agree) without equal gaps.                                        |
| Work status of women  | Nominal   | Categories (Employed, Unemployed, Student, Homemaker) with no ranking.                           |

# **Solution of Question-2**

#### (a) Frequency Distribution (6 marks)

1. **Definition.**
   A **frequency distribution** is an organized tabular display showing how often each distinct value (or class interval) of a variable occurs in a dataset.

2. **Purpose.**

   * To **summarize** large sets of raw data into a form that is easy to interpret.
   * To reveal the **shape** of the data (e.g. skew, modality).
   * To facilitate the construction of **graphs** (histograms, ogives, etc.).
   * To support calculation of descriptive measures (mean, median, mode, variance).

3. **Steps to Construct a Grouped Frequency Distribution:**

   1. **Decide Number of Classes, $k$.**
      A common rule is $k\approx \sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the sample size, or use Sturges’ formula $k=\lceil\log_2 n +1\rceil$.

   2. **Compute Class Width, $h$.**

$$
      h = \frac{\text{Range}}{k} = \frac{\max x_i - \min x_i}{k}.
$$

      Round up to a convenient value.

   3. **Determine Class Boundaries.**

      * Start at (or just below) the minimum value.
      * Add the class width successively to form non‐overlapping intervals $[L_1,U_1),[L_2,U_2),\dots$.

   4. **Tally Observations.**
      For each data point, place a tick in the corresponding class.

   5. **Count Frequencies.**
      Total the tallies for each class to get $f_j$.

   6. **Compute Relative/Percent Frequencies (optional).**

$$
      \text{Relative frequency} = \frac{f_j}{n},\quad
      \text{Percent frequency} = 100\%\times\frac{f_j}{n}.
$$

   7. **Check Totals.**
      Sum of $f_j$ should equal $n$. Sum of relative frequencies should equal 1.

#### (b) Bar Diagram (8 marks)

1. **Definition.**
   A **bar diagram** (bar chart) represents categorical data with rectangular bars whose heights (or lengths) are proportional to category frequencies or percentages.

2. **Types of Bar Diagrams:**

   | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                        | **Example**                                                 |
   | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Simple bar chart**  | One bar per category; bars separated by gaps.                                                          | Sales by product category: Electronics, Clothing, Groceries |
   | **Grouped bar chart** | Bars for two or more series grouped side-by-side within each category.                                 | Male vs. Female enrollment by department                    |
   | **Stacked bar chart** | Bars for multiple series stacked on top of each other, showing both total and component contributions. | Population by age group, stacked by gender                  |
   | **Percentage bar**    | Like stacked, but bars are scaled to the same height (100%), showing component percentages.            | Market share percentages of brands within each region       |
   | **Horizontal bar**    | Bars run horizontally; useful when category labels are long or many categories exist.                  | Frequency of various smartphone operating systems           |

3. **Construction Steps (Simple Bar Chart):**

   1. **Choose Categories** along the x-axis.
   2. **Scale y-axis** to cover frequencies (or percentages).
   3. **Draw Bars** of equal width; height = category frequency.
   4. **Label** axes, title, and—if needed—a legend.

#### (a) Median & Mode with Advantages (4 marks)

* **Median**

  * **Definition:** The middle value in an ordered dataset.

   * If _n_ is odd, it’s the ((n + 1)/2)ᵗʰ value.  
    * If _n_ is even, it’s the average of the (n/2)ᵗʰ and (n/2 + 1)ᵗʰ values.
.
  * **Advantages:**

    1. Not affected by extreme values (robust to outliers).
    2. Always yields a value within the data range.

* **Mode**

  * **Definition:** The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
  * **Advantages:**

    1. Can be used with **any** scale (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio).
    2. Indicates the most “typical” category or measurement.

#### (b) Box‐and‐Whisker Plot (6 marks)

Data (mg/dm):

$$
14,\;8,\;9,\;8,\;13,\;14,\;8,\;8,\;12,\;11,\;10,\;7,\;10,\;12,\;12
$$

1. **Sort:**

$$
   7,\;8,\;8,\;8,\;8,\;9,\;10,\;10,\;11,\;12,\;12,\;12,\;13,\;14,\;14
$$

2. **Compute Five‐Number Summary:**

   * **Min** $=7$
   * **Max** $=14$
   * **Median** ($Q_2$) = 8th value = $10$
   * **Lower half (below median):** 7,8,8,8,8,9,10 ⟹ **$Q_1$** = 4th of these = $8$
   * **Upper half (above median):** 10,11,12,12,12,13,14 ⟹ **$Q_3$** = 4th of these = $12$

3. **IQR:**

$$
   \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = 12 - 8 = 4.
$$

4. **Box‐Whisker Plot Description:**

```
   │        ┌─────────────┐        │
   │        │   ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓   │        │
   │ Min=7 ─┤ Q1=8  —  Q3=12 ├─ Max=14
   │        │      ▓  M=10  │        │
   │        └─────────────┘        │
```

* Whiskers extend from 7 to 14.
* Box spans 8 to 12.
* Median at 10 inside the box.

#### (c) First $n$ Natural Numbers: $\bar x = \text{Median} = \tfrac{n+1}2$ (4 marks)

1. **Arithmetic Mean**

$$
   \text{Sum of first }n = 1+2+\cdots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}2
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   \bar x = \frac{1}{n}\frac{n(n+1)}2 = \frac{n+1}2.
$$

2. **Median**

   * If $n$ is odd, the middle term is at position $\tfrac{n+1}2$.
   * If $n$ is even, the two middle terms are $\tfrac n2$ and $\tfrac n2+1$; their average is

$$
     \frac{\tfrac n2 + (\tfrac n2+1)}2 = \frac{n+1}2.
$$

Thus in both cases

$$
\boxed{\text{Mean} = \text{Median} = \frac{n+1}2.}
$$

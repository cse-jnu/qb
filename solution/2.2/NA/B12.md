## Question 1 (7 marks)

What are the key steps in deriving the iterative formula of the **Newton–Raphson method** to approximate roots of the equation $f(x)=0$? Hence, find the root of

$$
2x^3 - 2x - 5 = 0
$$

correct to four decimal places.

## Question 2 (7 marks)

Write the iterative method algorithm to solve $f(x)=0$. Using the **bisection method**, compute a root of

$$
x^3 - 4x - 9 = 0
$$

correct to six decimal places.

## Question 3 (7 marks)

Explain the step-by-step process of constructing **Newton’s forward difference interpolation** formula using a given set of data points. Then utilize Newton’s **divided difference** formula to derive a polynomial that fits the dataset comprising the points

$$
(1,2),\quad (2,3),\quad (4,6),\quad (6,6).
$$

## Question 4 (7 marks)

Write the basic steps of the **Lagrange interpolation** algorithm for the given set of data points:

|    $x$   |  0  | $\tfrac{\pi}{4}$ | $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ |
| :------: | :-: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
| $\sin x$ |  0  |      0.70711     |        1.0       |

Using Lagrange’s interpolation formula, find the value of

$$
\sin\bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{8}\bigr).
$$

## Question 6 (7 marks)

Derive the general quadrature formula for **equidistant ordinates** and hence obtain **Simpson’s 1/3 rule**. Using this rule, evaluate

$$
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\,dx
$$

with $h = \tfrac{1}{6}$.

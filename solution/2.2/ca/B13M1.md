### 1. What is computer structure and function?

**Structure** refers to **how** the hardware is organized into components and how those components are connected.  At the highest level, a stored‐program computer consists of:

* **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

  * **Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU)** – performs arithmetic and logical operations
  * **Registers** – small, fast storage (e.g. Program Counter, Instruction Register, Accumulator)
  * **Control Unit** – generates timing and control signals to coordinate operations

* **Main Memory**

  * A linear array of storage locations (words or bytes) holding both instructions and data

* **Input/Output (I/O) Devices**

  * Interfaces to the external world (keyboard, disk, display, network, etc.)

* **System Interconnection (Buses)**

  * Sets of parallel wires carrying addresses, data, and control signals

**Function** describes **what** each component does at run‐time:

1. **Instruction Fetch** – bring the next instruction from memory into the CPU
2. **Instruction Decode** – interpret the opcode and identify required operands
3. **Operand Fetch** – read data from registers or memory as needed
4. **Execute** – carry out the operation in the ALU (e.g. add, compare, logical AND)
5. **Result Store** – write results back to a register or memory
6. **I/O Control** – coordinate data transfers between CPU/memory and external devices

### 2. Illustrate IAS computer expanded structure with explanation

The IAS machine (von‐Neumann type) central components and registers can be laid out as follows:

```
                         ┌─────────────────────┐
                         │      Memory         │  ← 1000 words × 40 bits
                         └─────────────────────┘
                                   ▲    ▲
                  address bus──────┘    └────data bus
                                   │
                   ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
                   │           CPU                 │
                   │ ┌──────────┐  ┌────────────┐  │
   ┌──────────┐    │ │ Control  │  │ Arithmetic │  │    ┌──────────┐
   │  I/O     │◄──►│ │ Unit     │  │ & Logic    │◄─┼───►│  I/O     │
   └──────────┘    │ └──────────┘  │ Unit (ALU) │  │    └──────────┘
                   │               └────────────┘  │
                   │  Registers:               ┌───┴───┐
                   │  • PC (Program Counter)   │  AC   │
                   │  • IR (Instruction Reg.)  └───────┘
                   │  • MAR (Mem. Addr. Reg.)  ┌───────┐
                   │  • MBR (Mem. Buffer)      │  MQ   │
                   │  • IBR (Instr. Buffer)    └───────┘
                   └────────────────────────────┘
```

* **Memory** holds both instructions and data.
* **MAR/MDR (MBR)** form the interface to memory:

  * MAR ← address
  * MDR ↔ data
* **IR/IBR** hold the current instruction (opcode+address fields).
* **PC** points to the next instruction’s address.
* **AC/MQ** serve as the primary operand/result registers in the ALU.
* **Control Unit** sequences these steps via control signals.

---

### 3. Classify IAS instruction set with at least one example of each type

IAS instructions are divided into three classes by **reference**:

| Class                      | Description                                   | Example                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Memory-Reference**       | Operate on data in memory via AC/MQ registers | `ADD M(X)` – AC ← AC + M\[X]  |
| **Register-Reference**     | Operate solely on CPU registers (no memory)   | `CLA` – Clear AC (AC ← 0)     |
| **Input-Output Reference** | Control external I/O devices                  | `INP` – Read from I/O into AC |

> **Memory-Reference** instructions use two address fields (e.g. opcode + memory-address), whereas **Register-Reference** and **I/O Reference** are encoded directly in the instruction register and need no additional memory access.

---

### 4. Illustrate and explain instruction cycle state diagram

The **instruction cycle** proceeds through a fixed sequence of micro‐operations.  A common five‐state diagram (T₀…T₄) is:

```
  T₀ ───► T₁ ───► T₂ ───► T₃ ───► T₄
   |        |        |        |  
   ▼        ▼        ▼        ▼  
MAR←PC   MDR←M[MAR] IR←MDR  Execute
PC←PC+1  └────► decode └───► Write-back
```

1. **T₀**

   * `MAR ← PC`
2. **T₁**

   * `MDR ← M[MAR]` (fetch instruction)
3. **T₂**

   * `IR ← MDR(opcode)`
   * `MAR ← MDR(address)`
   * `PC ← PC + 1`
4. **T₃** (decode & fetch operands)

   * For memory-reference: `MDR ← M[MAR]`, `AC ← AC ☐ MDR` (where ☐ is the ALU operation)
   * For register-reference: directly perform on AC/MQ
5. **T₄** (write-back or I/O)

   * Store result back to memory or send/receive via I/O

After T₄, the cycle returns to T₀ for the next instruction.

### 5. What is interrupt? List the types of interrupts

An **interrupt** is an event (signal) that temporarily **suspends** the normal execution flow of the CPU so that a special routine (the interrupt handler) can respond to it.  After the handler finishes, the CPU **resumes** the interrupted program.

**Types of Interrupts**

1. **Hardware Interrupts** (asynchronous)

   * **Maskable Interrupt (IRQ₂)** – can be disabled by the CPU
   * **Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI)** – cannot be disabled (e.g. power failure)
   * **I/O Device Interrupts** – disk ready, keyboard, timer tick

2. **Software Interrupts** (synchronous)

   * **Trap** – intentionally invoked by a program (e.g. system call)
   * **Fault/Exception** – triggered by error conditions (divide-by-zero, invalid opcode)

---

### 6. Define computer bus. Explain the types of bus with proper direction and diagram

A **bus** is a **shared** set of parallel conductors that transfer data, addresses, and control signals among components.

| Bus Type        | Width            | Direction                           | Function                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Address Bus** | N bits (e.g. 16) | **Unidirectional** CPU → Memory/I-O | Carries the address of the location to read/write      |
| **Data Bus**    | M bits (e.g. 32) | **Bidirectional**                   | Carries actual data between CPU, memory, and I/O       |
| **Control Bus** | Several lines    | **Bi/Uni**                          | Carries read/write, interrupt, clock, and status lines |

```
   CPU
   ┌───────────┐
   │           │
   │  Control  │───►  control signals (read, write, IRQ, etc.)
   │  Address  │───►  memory/I-O address
   │  Data     │◄───►  data words
   └───────────┘
       │ │ │
 memory│ │ │I/O
   ┌───────────┐
   │  Memory   │
   └───────────┘
```

* **Address Bus**: only the CPU drives it (selects which memory or I/O device).
* **Data Bus**: can be driven by CPU, memory, or an I/O device.
* **Control Bus**: typically shared, with direction depending on the specific control line (e.g. Memory-Read is an output from CPU; Interrupt-Acknowledge may be input).

### 7. Illustrate and explain cache memory principle. Why cache memory needed?

**Principle of Cache**

* **Memory Hierarchy**: Registers → L1 Cache → L2/L3 Cache → Main Memory → Secondary Storage
* **Locality of Reference**:

  * **Temporal Locality** – recently accessed data/instructions are likely to be accessed again soon
  * **Spatial Locality** – data near recently accessed addresses are likely to be accessed soon

**Operation**

1. **CPU issues a memory request**

   * **Cache Lookup** (tag array + data array)
   * **Hit**: data found in cache → delivered in a few cycles
   * **Miss**: data not in cache → fetch block from main memory into cache, then deliver

2. **Block Replacement**

   * On a miss when cache is full, a block is evicted (e.g. using LRU) to make room

```
   ┌─────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
   │   CPU   │───►──│  Cache   │───►──│ Main Memory │
   └─────────┘      └──────────┘      └─────────────┘
        │               │  │             │
   request/data     hit│  │miss       DRAM│
```

**Why Cache Is Needed**

* **Bridges the speed gap** between very fast CPU and slower main memory
* **Improves average memory access time** by servicing most accesses at cache speed
* **Reduces CPU idle cycles** waiting for data

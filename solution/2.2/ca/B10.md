# Solution of Question-1

### **(a) Computer Organization vs. Computer Architecture**

- **Computer Organization** refers to the physical components of a computer system and their interconnections. It deals with how the hardware elements of a computer are designed, configured, and interconnected to achieve the desired functionality. Examples of hardware components include the CPU, memory, buses, and peripherals.

- **Computer Architecture**, on the other hand, focuses on the design principles, structure, and behavior of the computer system. It defines the functionality, instruction set architecture (ISA), and how the computer performs tasks. It’s about designing a system that can effectively execute instructions. Computer architecture takes into account aspects such as instruction formats, addressing modes, and control mechanisms.

### **(b) Dedicated CPU Registers**

1. **PC (Program Counter)**:
   The PC is a register in the CPU that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. After fetching an instruction, the PC is automatically incremented to point to the next instruction in the sequence.

2. **IR (Instruction Register)**:
   The IR holds the current instruction that is being decoded and executed by the CPU. Once the instruction is fetched from memory, it is placed in the IR for processing.

3. **SP (Stack Pointer)**:
   The SP is a register used to manage the call stack. It points to the top of the current stack, which stores function call information, return addresses, and local variables during program execution.

4. **Flag Registers**:
   Flag registers are used to store the status of the CPU, particularly after arithmetic and logical operations. These registers contain various flags such as Zero (Z), Carry (C), Negative (N), and Overflow (O), each of which indicates the result of an operation.

### **(c) Von Neumann Architecture**

Von Neumann Architecture is a computer architecture where a single memory space is used to store both data and instructions. The main parts of a computer under this architecture are:

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Includes the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and control unit (CU).
- **Memory**: Stores both program instructions and data.
- **Input/Output (I/O) Devices**: Facilitate communication with external entities.
- **Bus System**: Transfers data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

The architecture uses a shared bus to fetch instructions and data sequentially, which is one of the characteristics that differentiate it from other architectures like Harvard Architecture.

# Solution of Question-2

### **(a) Form a relationship between performance and execution time.**

Given:

- Computer A runs a program in **10 seconds**.
- Computer B runs the same program in **15 seconds**.

We can establish the performance ratio between the two computers using execution time:

**Performance is inversely related to execution time.**

- If **execution time** for Computer A is 10 seconds, and **execution time** for Computer B is 15 seconds, then:

  $$
  \text{Performance Ratio} = \frac{\text{Execution Time of B}}{\text{Execution Time of A}} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5
  $$

  Therefore, **Computer A** is **1.5 times faster** than **Computer B**.

---

### **(b) Answer the following questions based on the given tables:**

#### (i) **Which code sequence executes the most instructions?**

From **Table 2**, we have:

- **Code Sequence 1**:

  - A = 2 instructions
  - B = 1 instruction
  - C = 2 instructions
  - Total instructions = **2 + 1 + 2 = 5**

- **Code Sequence 2**:

  - A = 4 instructions
  - B = 1 instruction
  - C = 1 instruction
  - Total instructions = **4 + 1 + 1 = 6**

**Conclusion**: **Code Sequence 2** executes the most instructions.

#### (ii) **Which will be faster?**

We can calculate the execution time for both code sequences by using the formula:

$$
\text{Execution Time} = \text{Instruction Count} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}
$$

Where **CPI** (Clock Cycles Per Instruction) is given in **Table 1**.

- **For Code Sequence 1**:

  - A = 2 instructions → CPI = 1
  - B = 1 instruction → CPI = 2
  - C = 2 instructions → CPI = 3
  - Total time = $2 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10$

- **For Code Sequence 2**:

  - A = 4 instructions → CPI = 1
  - B = 1 instruction → CPI = 2
  - C = 1 instruction → CPI = 3
  - Total time = $4 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 3 = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9$

**Conclusion**: **Code Sequence 2** will be faster as its total execution time is **9** compared to **10** for Code Sequence 1.

#### (iii) **What is the CPI for each sequence?**

The **CPI (Clock Cycles Per Instruction)** is already provided for each instruction class in **Table 1**. Let's calculate the total CPI for both sequences:

- **For Code Sequence 1**:

  $$
  \text{CPI} = 2 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10
  $$

- **For Code Sequence 2**:

  $$
  \text{CPI} = 4 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 3 = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9
  $$

### **(e) Define response time and throughput. Write down some speedup techniques for a computer system.**

- **Response Time**:
  It is the time taken from the moment a request is submitted until the first response is produced by the system. For example, in a web application, it's the time between submitting a request (like clicking a link) and seeing the first part of the page load.

- **Throughput**:
  Throughput refers to the amount of work done by the system in a given period. For instance, in terms of computers, it’s how many tasks (or instructions) can be completed per unit of time.

**Speedup Techniques**:

1. **Pipelining**: Allows multiple instructions to be in different stages of execution simultaneously, improving throughput.
2. **Parallel Processing**: Divides tasks into smaller sub-tasks and processes them simultaneously across multiple processors or cores.
3. **Caching**: Using high-speed memory (cache) to store frequently accessed data reduces the time taken to fetch from slower storage.
4. **Branch Prediction**: Speeds up execution by guessing the direction of branches in programs, reducing the penalty of incorrect guesses.
5. **Increasing Clock Speed**: Involves speeding up the processor clock cycle to increase the rate of execution.

# Solution of Question-3

### **(a) Explain the basic format of a floating point number. Why is data normalization done?**

A **floating point number** is used to represent real numbers that are too large or too small to be represented as integers. The basic format of a floating point number follows the IEEE 754 standard and consists of three parts:

1. **Sign bit (S)**: This bit indicates whether the number is positive (0) or negative (1).
2. **Exponent (E)**: The exponent is used to scale the number. It represents how many times the base (usually 2) is multiplied or divided.
3. **Mantissa (M) or Fraction (F)**: The mantissa contains the significant digits of the number (i.e., the precision part of the number).

In single-precision floating point numbers, the format is:

- 1 bit for the sign
- 8 bits for the exponent
- 23 bits for the fraction (mantissa)

**Normalization** is done to represent the floating point number in a way that maximizes precision. It moves the decimal point (or binary point) to a position where the number has a single non-zero digit to the left of the point. For binary floating-point representation, the normalization process ensures that the leading bit of the mantissa is always 1, which helps save space and represents the number more efficiently.

### **(b) Write about Big-Endian and Little-Endian storage methods. What do tags do?**

- **Big-Endian**: In Big-Endian storage, the most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, i.e., the highest order byte is placed first. For example, for a 4-byte integer, the MSB will be stored in the first byte, followed by the other bytes.

  Example:
  For a 4-byte number `0x12345678`:

  ```
  Memory[0] = 0x12
  Memory[1] = 0x34
  Memory[2] = 0x56
  Memory[3] = 0x78
  ```

- **Little-Endian**: In Little-Endian storage, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, i.e., the lowest order byte is placed first. The order of bytes is reversed compared to Big-Endian.

  Example:
  For a 4-byte number `0x12345678`:

  ```
  Memory[0] = 0x78
  Memory[1] = 0x56
  Memory[2] = 0x34
  Memory[3] = 0x12
  ```

**Tags** in computer systems generally refer to a label or identifier used to store or organize data, especially in contexts like memory management, networking, and databases. Tags help identify, access, or manipulate the data more efficiently.

### **(c) What is the binary representation for the single-precision floating point number that corresponds to N = -12.25? What is the normalized binary representation for the number?**

To convert **-12.25** into a single-precision floating point number (IEEE 754), follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Convert the absolute value of 12.25 into binary.

- **12** in decimal is **1100** in binary.
- **0.25** in decimal is **0.01** in binary (since 0.25 \* 2 = 0.5, remainder is 0, multiply 0.5 by 2 = 1, remainder is 1).

Thus, **12.25** in binary is:

$$
12.25 = 1100.01
$$

#### Step 2: Normalize the number.

We normalize the binary number to have a single non-zero digit to the left of the binary point:

$$
1100.01 = 1.10001 \times 2^3
$$

So, the normalized form is **1.10001 × 2³**.

#### Step 3: Determine the sign bit.

Since the number is **negative**, the sign bit will be **1**.

#### Step 4: Calculate the exponent and bias.

In IEEE 754 single-precision format:

- The exponent is stored with a bias of **127**.
- The actual exponent is **3**, so the stored exponent will be:

$$
\text{Exponent} = 3 + 127 = 130
$$

In binary, **130** is **10000010**.

#### Step 5: Determine the mantissa.

The mantissa (fraction) is derived from the digits to the right of the binary point. For **1.10001**, we take the digits after the binary point:

$$
\text{Mantissa} = 10001000000000000000000 \text{ (23 bits)}
$$

#### Step 6: Combine the parts.

Now, combine the sign bit, exponent, and mantissa:

- Sign bit = 1
- Exponent = 10000010
- Mantissa = 10001000000000000000000

Thus, the single-precision binary representation of **-12.25** is:

$$
1 \ | \ 10000010 \ | \ 10001000000000000000000
$$

---

**Normalized binary representation**:
The normalized binary representation is already **1.10001 × 2³**.

# Solution of Question-4

### **(a) What is instruction set architecture (ISA)? Write the differences between RISC and CISC.**

**Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**:
ISA is the interface between a computer’s hardware and software. It defines the set of instructions that a CPU can execute, including the operations, operands, addressing modes, and formats. It serves as the blueprint for how software interacts with the hardware.

**Differences between RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)**:

| Feature                | RISC                                             | CISC                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction Set**    | Smaller, simpler instructions                    | Larger, more complex instructions             |
| **Execution Time**     | Each instruction typically takes one clock cycle | Instructions may take multiple clock cycles   |
| **Memory Usage**       | More instructions needed for a task              | Fewer instructions needed for a task          |
| **Instruction Length** | Fixed length (usually 32 bits)                   | Variable length (8, 16, 32, etc.)             |
| **Examples**           | ARM, MIPS, SPARC                                 | x86, Intel 8086, Z80                          |
| **Performance**        | Better performance due to simpler instructions   | Performance depends on instruction complexity |

---

### **(b) Explain direct addressing and indirect addressing mode in brief with examples.**

- **Direct Addressing Mode**:
  In direct addressing mode, the operand (the data to be operated upon) is directly specified in the instruction. The address field of the instruction contains the actual memory address of the operand.

  **Example**:
  If the instruction is `MOV A, [5000]`, it means that the operand is located at memory address `5000`, and the content from memory address `5000` is moved to register `A`.

- **Indirect Addressing Mode**:
  In indirect addressing mode, the address field of the instruction refers to a memory location that holds the address of the operand. So, the instruction indirectly specifies where the actual data is located.

  **Example**:
  If the instruction is `MOV A, [R1]` and `R1` holds the value `5000`, then the operand is located at memory address `5000`, and the content from memory address `5000` is moved to register `A`.

### **(c) Draw the flowchart for Booth Algorithm for multiplication and explain it with the example of A × B, where A = 1101₂ and B = 1110₂.**

**Booth's Algorithm** is used for multiplying binary numbers in an efficient way, especially when there are negative numbers involved. The algorithm works with pairs of bits in the multiplier and handles both positive and negative multiplicands.

#### Steps in Booth's Algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set `A = 0` (n bits, initialized to 0).
   - Set `Q = multiplier` (binary representation of B).
   - Set `Q-1 = 0` (additional bit for shifting).
   - Set `M = multiplicand` (binary representation of A).
   - Set `count = number of bits in B` (this defines the loop iterations).

2. **Performing the Algorithm**:
   For each iteration (based on the number of bits):

   - Look at the last two bits of `Q` (Q₀ and Q₋₁).
   - Based on the pair, perform one of the following:

     - `00`: Do nothing (no operation).
     - `01`: Add `M` to `A`.
     - `10`: Subtract `M` from `A`.
     - `11`: Do nothing (no operation).

   - After each operation, shift `A`, `Q`, and `Q-1` to the right.

3. **Repeat for the number of bits** in `B`.

4. **Final Result**:
   After completing all iterations, the result will be in `A` and `Q`.

#### Example:

Given:

- A = `1101₂` = -3 (in 4-bit signed two's complement)
- B = `1110₂` = -2 (in 4-bit signed two's complement)

Using Booth's algorithm:

1. **Initial Values**:

   - `A = 0000` (4 bits for simplicity, as the size is 4-bit)
   - `Q = 1110`
   - `Q-1 = 0`
   - `M = 1101`
   - `count = 4`

2. **Iteration 1** (Q₀Q₋₁ = 10): Subtract M from A.

   - `A = A - M = 0000 - 1101 = 0011`
   - Perform a right shift of `A, Q, Q-1`.

3. **Iteration 2** (Q₀Q₋₁ = 11): No operation.

4. **Iteration 3** (Q₀Q₋₁ = 10): Subtract M from A.

   - `A = A - M = 0011 - 1101 = 1110`
   - Perform a right shift of `A, Q, Q-1`.

5. **Iteration 4** (Q₀Q₋₁ = 01): Add M to A.

   - `A = A + M = 1110 + 1101 = 1011`
   - Perform a right shift of `A, Q, Q-1`.

After completing all iterations, the result in `A` and `Q` is the product of A and B.

# Solution of Question-5

### **(a) Briefly write about MIPS. What are exceptions and interrupts?**

**MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages)**:
MIPS is a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture that is widely used in academic settings for learning and understanding processor design. It uses a simple set of instructions that can be executed in a single clock cycle, which helps make the processor efficient and easy to implement.

- **Characteristics of MIPS**:

  - Fixed-length instructions (32 bits).
  - Load-store architecture, meaning it only allows memory access through load and store instructions.
  - Uses a set of registers (32 general-purpose registers).
  - Simple instruction formats (R-type, I-type, and J-type).

**Exceptions and Interrupts**:

- **Exceptions**: These are conditions that arise during the execution of a program, causing an abnormal behavior. They may include errors like division by zero, invalid memory access, or illegal instruction execution. Exceptions are handled by the processor using an exception handler.

- **Interrupts**: An interrupt is an external signal that causes the CPU to stop its current execution and switch to an interrupt handler. Interrupts can be triggered by hardware devices (e.g., keyboard input, timer) or software. They allow the CPU to respond to real-time events.

---

### **(b) What is spilling? Explain virtual memory.**

- **Spilling**: Spilling occurs when there are not enough registers to hold all the required variables for a computation in a program. In such cases, some variables are moved from the registers to memory (usually the stack), and this process is referred to as "spilling". It happens when there are too many variables to fit into the limited register space.

- **Virtual Memory**: Virtual memory is a memory management technique that creates an illusion for users that they have a large, contiguous block of memory, even though the physical memory may be smaller or fragmented. Virtual memory uses both physical RAM and disk space to manage memory. This enables running large programs without worrying about the physical limitations of RAM. The operating system handles translating between virtual and physical memory addresses through page tables and swapping.

---

### **(c) What is the mapping process? Briefly explain the Associative mapping and direct mapping.**

- **Mapping Process**:
  The mapping process refers to how data is transferred between different levels of memory or cache. Specifically, in the context of cache memory, the mapping process defines how the memory addresses are assigned to cache lines. Efficient mapping allows faster access to frequently used data and improves system performance.

- **Associative Mapping**:
  In associative mapping (also known as fully associative mapping), any block of data from memory can be stored in any cache line. When searching for a data item, the entire cache is searched for the corresponding block. This method provides maximum flexibility but requires more hardware (comparators) to search the cache.

  **Example**: If the data from memory address `X` is to be stored, it can be placed in any cache line, and to fetch it, the cache will search all lines to find the block corresponding to address `X`.

- **Direct Mapping**:
  In direct mapping, each block of memory is mapped to a specific cache line based on its memory address. The cache line is determined by dividing the memory address by the number of cache lines. This method is simple and fast but can cause cache misses if multiple memory blocks map to the same cache line.

  **Example**: Memory address `X` will always map to a specific cache line determined by a direct formula (such as `X mod cache_size`). Only one data block can be stored in each cache line.

# Solution of Question-6

### **(a) Write down the techniques for I/O operation. Describe direct memory access.**

**Techniques for I/O Operations:**

1. **Programmed I/O (PIO)**:
   In programmed I/O, the CPU is responsible for transferring data between the I/O device and memory. The CPU continuously checks the I/O device status to ensure the transfer is complete. This is the simplest method but can be inefficient as the CPU spends time waiting.

2. **Interrupt-driven I/O**:
   In interrupt-driven I/O, the I/O device sends an interrupt signal to the CPU when it is ready for data transfer. The CPU then stops its current task, handles the interrupt, and resumes processing. This is more efficient than programmed I/O since the CPU does not need to constantly check the I/O device.

3. **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**:
   DMA is a method where the I/O controller can directly transfer data between memory and the I/O device without involving the CPU. This technique significantly improves performance by freeing the CPU from being involved in every data transfer. The CPU only needs to initiate the transfer and handle interruptions when the transfer is complete.

   **Direct Memory Access Description**:

   - In DMA, the DMA controller handles data transfer directly between I/O devices and memory.
   - The CPU sets up the DMA controller by specifying the source and destination addresses, the data size, and the direction of transfer (read or write).
   - The DMA controller manages the entire data transfer, which reduces CPU load and allows the CPU to perform other tasks.

---

### **(b) What is interrupt-driven I/O? What are the drawbacks of programmed and interrupt-driven I/O?**

- **Interrupt-driven I/O**:
  In interrupt-driven I/O, an I/O device interrupts the CPU when it is ready to transfer data. The interrupt informs the CPU that the I/O device requires attention, and the CPU stops its current task to process the interrupt. After completing the I/O operation, the CPU resumes its previous task.

  **Drawbacks of Programmed I/O**:

  - **CPU Time Wastage**: The CPU must constantly check the status of the I/O device, which wastes CPU time and processing power.
  - **Inefficient**: It is inefficient because the CPU cannot perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

  **Drawbacks of Interrupt-driven I/O**:

  - **Overhead from Interrupt Handling**: Handling interrupts introduces additional overhead since the CPU must save its current state, process the interrupt, and then restore its previous state.
  - **Interrupt Contention**: If there are multiple I/O devices generating interrupts, it can cause the CPU to become overloaded with handling interrupts, leading to delays.

---

### **(c) What is cache coherence? Write the hardware and software-based solutions for cache coherence.**

**Cache Coherence**:
Cache coherence refers to the consistency of data stored in different caches in a multiprocessor system. When multiple processors have their own caches, they might store copies of the same memory location. If one processor updates its cache, the other caches must be updated to maintain consistency.

**Hardware-Based Solutions for Cache Coherence**:

1. **MESI Protocol (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid)**:
   This protocol defines the states of each cache line and ensures that all processors' caches are synchronized. It involves four states for a cache line:

   - **Modified**: The cache has the only copy of the data, and it has been modified.
   - **Exclusive**: The cache has the only copy, and it is unmodified.
   - **Shared**: Multiple caches may have copies of the data, but it is not modified.
   - **Invalid**: The cache line is not valid.

2. **Write Propagation**:
   This involves ensuring that when one processor writes to a cache line, the other caches either invalidate or update their copies of the data to reflect the change.

**Software-Based Solutions for Cache Coherence**:

1. **Locks and Semaphores**:
   Software techniques like locks and semaphores can be used to control access to shared memory, ensuring that only one processor can access or modify a cache line at a time.

2. **Software Cache Synchronization**:
   In this approach, the software explicitly manages the cache by synchronizing cache accesses, ensuring that the data is consistent across all processors' caches.

# Solution of Question-7

### **(a) What is a cluster? Compare clusters with symmetric multiprocessors (SMP).**

- **Cluster**:
  A cluster is a collection of independent computers or nodes that work together to perform tasks as if they were a single system. These systems are typically connected by a high-speed network and share resources such as storage and processing power. Clusters are often used to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

- **Comparison between Clusters and Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP)**:

| Feature             | Cluster                                                            | Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP)                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**    | Multiple independent computers connected via a network             | Multiple processors sharing a single memory and I/O system               |
| **Scalability**     | High scalability as new nodes can be added easily                  | Limited scalability due to shared memory and bus contention              |
| **Memory Access**   | Distributed memory (each node has its own memory)                  | Shared memory for all processors                                         |
| **Fault Tolerance** | High fault tolerance, as failure of one node doesn't affect others | Lower fault tolerance, as failure in any processor can affect the system |
| **Cost**            | More cost-effective, especially for large systems                  | More expensive due to the need for a tightly integrated architecture     |
| **Example**         | Hadoop clusters, Beowulf clusters                                  | Intel’s Symmetric Multiprocessor architecture                            |

### **(b) How is cache miss handled by the write buffer and write-back mechanism?**

- **Write Buffer**:
  A write buffer is used to temporarily hold data that is being written to memory. When a processor writes to memory, the data is first stored in the write buffer, allowing the processor to continue executing without waiting for the write to be completed. This helps improve performance by reducing memory access latency. If a cache miss occurs, the data is written to the write buffer, and the processor can continue executing while the data is written to memory.

- **Write-Back Mechanism**:
  In the write-back mechanism, when data is modified in the cache, it is not immediately written to main memory. Instead, the cache line is marked as "dirty," and the data is only written back to the memory when it is replaced or evicted from the cache. This reduces the number of write operations to memory and improves the performance of the system.

  **Handling Cache Miss**:

  - When a cache miss occurs, the data is fetched from the next level (e.g., main memory).
  - If the cache is using a write-back mechanism, any dirty data that was modified in the cache but not yet written to memory will be written back to memory when evicted.
  - The write buffer temporarily stores the data during this process, enabling the CPU to proceed with its operations without waiting for the memory update.

---

### **(c) Describe loop buffers. Draw the branch prediction state diagram.**

- **Loop Buffers**:
  A loop buffer is a small, high-speed buffer used to store frequently executed instructions in a loop. It is designed to reduce the overhead of fetching instructions from memory during repetitive loop executions. The loop buffer stores the instructions of a loop so that when the processor reaches the loop, it can fetch the instructions from the buffer instead of from the slower main memory, thus improving execution speed.

- **Branch Prediction State Diagram**:
  Branch prediction is a technique used in processors to guess the direction of a branch (e.g., in an `if` statement) before the condition is evaluated. This is done to keep the pipeline full and avoid delays. Branch prediction state diagrams typically use a 2-bit saturating counter to predict the branch direction, which helps mitigate the impact of incorrect predictions.

  **Branch Prediction State Diagram**:

  ```
  Strongly Taken (11)  ---->  Weakly Taken (10)  ---->  Weakly Not Taken (01)  ---->  Strongly Not Taken (00)
  |---------------------->------------------------>----------------------------|
  ```

  **Explanation**:

  - **Strongly Taken (11)**: The branch is very likely to be taken.
  - **Weakly Taken (10)**: The branch is sometimes taken, sometimes not.
  - **Weakly Not Taken (01)**: The branch is sometimes not taken, sometimes taken.
  - **Strongly Not Taken (00)**: The branch is very likely not to be taken.

  The branch prediction state changes based on the actual behavior of the branch. If the prediction was correct, the state stays the same; if it was incorrect, the state is updated to a more accurate prediction.

# Solution of Question-8

### **(a) How write buffer and write-back mechanism handle the cache miss?**

- **Write Buffer**:
  A write buffer is used to temporarily store data that is being written to memory. When a cache miss occurs, the data is fetched from the next level (typically the main memory). The write buffer holds the data until the cache miss is resolved, allowing the processor to continue execution without waiting for the data to be written to memory. This reduces the overhead and improves CPU efficiency.

  In the case of a cache miss:

  - If the data is not in the cache, the write buffer holds the data temporarily while the cache fetches it from memory.
  - Once the data is fetched from memory, the write buffer transfers the data to the cache.

- **Write-back Mechanism**:
  In a write-back cache, when data in the cache is modified, the change is not immediately written to memory. Instead, the cache line is marked as "dirty", and the data is written back to memory only when it is evicted from the cache. This reduces the frequency of writes to memory, improving performance.

  Handling Cache Miss with Write-back:

  - When a cache miss occurs and the data is not found in the cache, the processor fetches the data from memory.
  - If the cache is using a write-back mechanism, the data may be written back to memory if the cache line is dirty (modified), or it may simply be loaded into the cache without affecting memory.

### **(b) What is a cluster? Compare clusters with symmetric multiprocessors (SMP).**

- **Cluster**:
  A cluster is a group of independent computers (also called nodes) that are connected via a network and work together to perform tasks as a single system. Clusters are used to improve computational power, scalability, and fault tolerance. Each node in a cluster has its own memory and processor, and they typically share storage resources.

- **Comparison between Clusters and Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP)**:

| Feature             | Cluster                                                            | Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP)                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**    | Multiple independent computers connected via a network             | Multiple processors sharing a single memory and I/O system               |
| **Scalability**     | High scalability as new nodes can be added easily                  | Limited scalability due to shared memory and bus contention              |
| **Memory Access**   | Distributed memory (each node has its own memory)                  | Shared memory for all processors                                         |
| **Fault Tolerance** | High fault tolerance, as failure of one node doesn't affect others | Lower fault tolerance, as failure in any processor can affect the system |
| **Cost**            | More cost-effective, especially for large systems                  | More expensive due to the need for a tightly integrated architecture     |
| **Example**         | Hadoop clusters, Beowulf clusters                                  | Intel’s Symmetric Multiprocessor architecture                            |

### **(c) What is an array multiplier? Illustrate a 5x5 array multiplier.**

- **Array Multiplier**:
  An array multiplier is a hardware implementation for multiplying two numbers using an array of multipliers and adders. The array multiplier simplifies the process by using a grid of cells to perform partial products of the numbers to be multiplied. It is efficient in hardware but can be slow compared to other methods like the Wallace tree multiplier when working with larger numbers.

- **Illustrating a 5x5 Array Multiplier**:

  In a 5x5 array multiplier, two 5-bit numbers are multiplied. The multiplication is performed by generating partial products for each bit of the two numbers. These partial products are then added together to form the final product.

  **Steps**:

  1. Take two 5-bit binary numbers, say A = A₄A₃A₂A₁A₀ and B = B₄B₃B₂B₁B₀.
  2. Generate the partial products (using AND gates) for each combination of bits from A and B.
  3. Use adders (usually half-adders and full-adders) to add these partial products together.

  **Illustration**:

  Let's say A = 11001 and B = 10110. The 5x5 array multiplier generates partial products, which are then summed to give the final product.

  ```
    A = 11001
    B = 10110

    Partial Products:

    P₀ = A₀ × B (all shifted by 0 to 4 places)
    P₁ = A₁ × B (all shifted by 1 to 5 places)
    P₂ = A₂ × B (all shifted by 2 to 6 places)
    P₃ = A₃ × B (all shifted by 3 to 7 places)
    P₄ = A₄ × B (all shifted by 4 to 8 places)

    Add these partial products to get the final product.
  ```

  The structure for the 5x5 array multiplier is typically represented by a grid of AND gates and adders that handle the partial products and final summation.

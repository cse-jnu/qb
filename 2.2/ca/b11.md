### (a) Define user CPU time and system CPU time

* **User CPU time** refers to the amount of time the CPU spends executing the instructions of a program, excluding time spent on OS activities. It's the time directly associated with the program’s execution.

* **System CPU time** is the total time the CPU spends performing system-level tasks on behalf of the program. This includes tasks like handling system calls, input/output operations, and other operating system functions that the program indirectly uses.

### (c) Can’t we make CPU faster with faster clock?

Increasing the clock speed of the CPU can make it faster, but **only to a certain extent**. The performance improvement will eventually be limited by factors like:

* **Heat Dissipation**: Higher clock speeds generate more heat, which can lead to thermal throttling and potential damage if not properly managed.

* **Power Consumption**: The CPU requires more power at higher clock speeds, which can make it inefficient in terms of energy consumption.

* **Other Bottlenecks**: If other components like memory or I/O devices are slower, increasing the CPU clock speed won’t have a significant effect on overall system performance.

Thus, **clock speed alone is not a panacea for improving CPU performance**. Other architectural improvements (e.g., more cores, better instruction pipelining) are also required.

### (d) Our favourite program runs in 10 seconds on computer A, which has a 2 GHz clock. We are trying to help a computer designer build a computer, B, which will run this program in 6 seconds. The designer has determined that a substantial increase in the clock rate is possible, but this increase will affect the rest of the CPU design, causing computer B to require 1.2 times as many clock cycles as computer A for this program. What clock rate should we tell the designer to target?

#### Solution:

We know the following:

* Time on computer A = 10 seconds
* Clock rate of computer A = 2 GHz (which is 2 × 10⁹ Hz)
* Time on computer B = 6 seconds
* Computer B requires 1.2 times as many clock cycles as computer A.

We will use the formula for performance, which relates execution time, clock cycles, and clock rate:

$$
\text{Execution Time} = \frac{\text{Clock Cycles}}{\text{Clock Rate}}
$$

For computer A:

$$
\text{Clock Cycles}_A = \text{Execution Time}_A \times \text{Clock Rate}_A = 10 \, \text{seconds} \times 2 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} = 2 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cycles}
$$

For computer B, the number of clock cycles will be:

$$
\text{Clock Cycles}_B = 1.2 \times \text{Clock Cycles}_A = 1.2 \times 2 \times 10^{10} = 2.4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cycles}
$$

Since we know the time for computer B is 6 seconds, we can calculate the clock rate for computer B:

$$
\text{Clock Rate}_B = \frac{\text{Clock Cycles}_B}{\text{Execution Time}_B} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{10}}{6} = 4 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}
$$

Thus, the clock rate for computer B should be **4 GHz** to meet the 6-second target.

### (e) Why does the clock cycle play a crucial role in sequential circuits?

The clock cycle is crucial in **sequential circuits** because it:

1. **Synchronizes Events**: In sequential circuits, the output depends on the current state and the previous input. The clock signal ensures that all components of the circuit work in sync, allowing the state to change only at precise moments.

2. **Controls Timing**: The clock cycle defines the intervals during which different parts of the circuit can perform operations, ensuring that data is processed in an orderly fashion.

3. **Enables State Transitions**: In sequential logic, such as flip-flops or registers, the clock signal triggers state transitions, making the circuit behave predictably over time.

4. **Prevents Data Corruption**: Without a proper clock cycle, data could be read or written at incorrect times, leading to corruption or inconsistency in the operation of the circuit.

Thus, the **clock cycle** regulates timing, ensures synchronization, and is critical for maintaining correct operation in sequential logic circuits.

### **(a) Differentiate between Big-Endian and Little-Endian storage method**

| **Aspect**                 | **Big-Endian**                                                                     | **Little-Endian**                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**             | The most significant byte (MSB) is stored first (at the lowest memory address).    | The least significant byte (LSB) is stored first (at the lowest memory address). |
| **Storage order**          | Higher order bytes are stored at lower memory addresses.                           | Lower order bytes are stored at lower memory addresses.                          |
| **Example**                | For 0x12345678, it is stored as 12 34 56 78.                                       | For 0x12345678, it is stored as 78 56 34 12.                                     |
| **Used in**                | Motorola processors, Network protocols (e.g., IP)                                  | Intel processors, x86 architecture                                               |
| **Interpretation of data** | Easier to read in human-friendly format in networks and higher-level applications. | Used for efficiency in computation and data processing in modern computing.      |

### **(b) Which computer is faster for this program and by how much?**

Let's calculate the execution time for both computers A and B using the formula:

$$
\text{Execution Time} = \text{Clock Cycle Time} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Instruction Count}
$$

* **For Computer A**:

  * Clock cycle time = 250 ps
  * CPI = 2.0
  * We are not given the exact instruction count directly, but we are comparing clock cycle times, so let's use this for comparison.

$$
\text{Execution Time}_A = 250 \, \text{ps} \times 2.0 = 500 \, \text{ps}
$$

* **For Computer B**:

  * Clock cycle time = 500 ps
  * CPI = 1.2

$$
\text{Execution Time}_B = 500 \, \text{ps} \times 1.2 = 600 \, \text{ps}
$$

**Conclusion**:

* **Computer A** is faster because 500 ps < 600 ps.
* **By how much**: 600 ps - 500 ps = **100 ps** faster.

### **(c) Which code sequence executes the most instructions? Which will be faster? What is the CPI for each sequence?**

We are given two code sequences with instruction counts and CPIs:

| **Code Sequence** | **Instruction Counts for Each Instruction Class** | **CPI for Each Class** | **Execution Time (for each sequence)**                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sequence 1**    | A = 2, B = 1, C = 2                               | A = 1, B = 2, C = 3    | $2 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10$ |
| **Sequence 2**    | A = 4, B = 1, C = 1                               | A = 1, B = 2, C = 3    | $4 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 3 = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9$  |

#### **Which sequence executes the most instructions?**

* **Sequence 1** executes 10 instructions, whereas **Sequence 2** executes 9 instructions.
* Thus, **Sequence 1** executes the most instructions.

#### **Which sequence will be faster?**

To calculate which sequence will be faster, we use the formula:

$$
\text{Execution Time} = \text{CPI} \times \text{Instruction Count} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}
$$

Since the clock cycle times for both sequences are the same, we can directly compare the total CPI \* instruction count values.

* For **Sequence 1**, the execution time is $10$.
* For **Sequence 2**, the execution time is $9$.

Therefore, **Sequence 2** will be faster because it has a lower execution time.

#### **CPI for each sequence:**

* **Sequence 1 CPI**: The CPIs are given directly for Sequence 1 as:

  * A = 1, B = 2, C = 3.

* **Sequence 2 CPI**: The CPIs are given directly for Sequence 2 as:

  * A = 1, B = 2, C = 3.

# Solution of Question-3

### **(a) MIPS Assembly Code for the Given C Loop**

We are given the C loop:

```c
while (save[i] == k)
    i++;
```

In MIPS:

* The array **save** is represented by the register **\$s6** (which contains the base address of the array).
* **i** corresponds to **\$s3**.
* **k** corresponds to **\$s4**.

In MIPS, we need to:

1. Load the value from **save\[i]** into a register.
2. Compare **save\[i]** with **k**.
3. If they are equal, increment **i**.

**MIPS Assembly Code**:

```asm
    lw    $t0, 0($s6)      # Load save[i] into $t0 (t0 = save[i])
    beq   $t0, $s4, loop    # If save[i] == k, jump to loop
    addi  $s3, $s3, 1       # Increment i (i = i + 1)
loop:
```

Explanation:

* `lw` loads the value of **save\[i]** into register **\$t0**.
* `beq` compares the value in **\$t0** (save\[i]) with **\$s4** (k). If they are equal, it jumps to `loop`.
* `addi` increments the value of **\$s3** (i).

---

### **(b) Values of Registers After the MIPS Instructions**

We are given the following binary numbers for registers **\$s0** and **\$s1**:

* **\$s0** has the binary number:

  ```
  1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 (0xFFFFFFFF)
  ```
* **\$s1** has the binary number:

  ```
  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 (0x00000001)
  ```

The MIPS instructions are:

1. `slt  $t0, $s0, $s1`  (Set \$t0 to 1 if \$s0 < \$s1, else set \$t0 to 0)
2. `sltu $t1, $s0, $s1` (Set \$t1 to 1 if unsigned \$s0 < \$s1, else set \$t1 to 0)

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **slt \$t0, \$s0, \$s1**:

   * **\$s0** is **0xFFFFFFFF** (signed value = -1).
   * **\$s1** is **0x00000001** (signed value = 1).
   * Since **-1** (value of **\$s0**) is less than **1** (value of **\$s1**), the result is **1**.
   * **\$t0** will be set to **1**.

2. **sltu \$t1, \$s0, \$s1**:

   * In **unsigned comparison**, **0xFFFFFFFF** is treated as a large positive number (4,294,967,295), and **0x00000001** is treated as 1.
   * Since **4,294,967,295** (value of **\$s0**) is greater than **1** (value of **\$s1**) in unsigned comparison, the result is **0**.
   * **\$t1** will be set to **0**.

Thus, after the instructions:

* **\$t0 = 1**
* **\$t1 = 0**

### **(c) MIPS Execution Sequence for a Program**

To write the execution sequence of a program using MIPS instructions, we need a specific program or set of operations. However, since the problem doesn't provide a complete code segment for this question, a generic sequence could look something like the following:

1. **Load data into registers**:

   ```asm
   lw    $t0, 0($s6)  # Load word from memory at address in $s6 into $t0
   ```

2. **Perform computation or comparison**:

   ```asm
   add   $t1, $t0, $s4  # Add value in $t0 and $s4, store result in $t1
   slt   $t2, $t0, $s4  # Set $t2 to 1 if $t0 < $s4, else set to 0
   ```

3. **Store result back to memory**:

   ```asm
   sw    $t1, 4($s6)  # Store the value in $t1 to memory at the address in $s6 + 4
   ```

4. **Jump or branch**:

   ```asm
   beq   $t2, $zero, exit  # Branch to exit if $t2 is zero
   ```

This sequence involves loading data from memory, performing computations, storing results, and branching based on conditions.
